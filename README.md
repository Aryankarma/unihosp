# UniHosp - United Hospital
---
UniHosp stands for United Hospitals acronym we made for our website name. We built this project with the thinking to convert entire health sector digital by recording all the medical history of the citizen of India into database and which they can by a given Uni ID which a user can create during the registration. We are trying built a prototype to connect  all the hospital like UPI connected all the banks for online revolution of Indian Financial Sector.

## Problem Being Addressed
Suppose a person had a medical surgery in one state and changed city after few years. If he needed a new surgery the doctor might need past medical records and checkup reports. 
Now If that is the case it can be possible that those documents got lost or damaged or not in very good condition to be read or understand. And if that's the case, that person might to go through another body check up which is cost him a lot money. As India's health sector is not cheap, If you are in India there is great chance you know that.

## Solution 
There is very simple solution to convert entire health sector of India digital and save all  the data related to citizens health in clouds and give access to user of these services to monitor there health profile and control the access who see and who can't so that can be accessed as they need the profile can be shared.

This service will work like UPI, Every Person will be given a Uni ID as we named it for a while. With the Help Of Uni ID hospitals will be able update citizen health report on cloud which is going to be managed centrally like any other servers. User is can access these reports in there Health Profile.

## Addressed Problem and Services

1. Anytime access of past medical records using UniID
